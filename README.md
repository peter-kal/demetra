# demetra

I've been using and enjoying flutter apps for a while on my Ubuntu machine.
One of them was Purple Task, but the snap package of it was pretty outdated, I thought about re-snapping it for my use(and maybe make a PR).
After some tries I gave up, I don't have a lot of experience with Flutter( I am still learning) and the app was 2-years-old, so whatever I tried ended up breaking.

Then I decided to just write a new to-do app.
The name is Demetra (no real reason I just like naming things with ancient greek gods' names) and there were many advantages on it.

1) Demetra is using Yaru, meaning it looks ways better and integrates the computer's theme 
2) Two years after the initial support of Flutter on linux it has improved a lot, so all of that helps the app 
3) A newer and better Snap.
